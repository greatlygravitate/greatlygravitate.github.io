        <h3>The Universe</h3>
        <p>The Universe is all of space and what's inside it. The Observable Universe is the place which we can currently experience from Earth. But, if you go deeper, we can see galaxies that we can not interact with. Thats because galaxies are moving out of the Local Group, a group of the universe that we are almost trapped in becuase of extreme gravity, but we can see them becuase of the speed of light. Though light (299,792,458 metres per second) is the fastest way to travel, it still takes time. So you are seeing galaxies from a long time ago. </p>
